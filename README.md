Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design , development ,testing and maintenance of software applicactions.(Beutel R.A.1991)

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering is the process of designing ,developing , testing and maintaining software systems using engineering concepts and methodologies. It highlights a methodical and disciplined approach to software development with an emphasis on sustainibilty, dependability and quality. Traditional programming is often more focused on individual coding skills and getting the code to work. 

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase?
Software Development Life Cycle consist of phases  each phase with distict goals deliverables and activities. The (SDLC) provides a structured approach to software development ensuring that software meets users needs and is delivered efficienlyt. The (SDLC) includes the following phases
1.Requirements gathering: collecting user needs and defining software.
2.Analsis: Breaking down requirements into smaller manageable parts.
3. Design : Creating software architecture user interface and system design.
4. Implimentation: Writing code and building the software.
5.Testing: Verfying software functionality perfomance and making it available to users.
6. Deploymant: Realeasing software to production and making it availablwe to users .
7. Maintanance: Updating fixing and enhancing software after realease.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models: 
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile : Focuses on creating working software quickly collaborating with customers frequenlty and being able to adapt to chanes easily. Iterative,flexible and incremental approach.
Waterfall: It is a sequential development process that flows like a water through all phases of a project,analysis design development and testing for example with each phase.Linear phase by phase approach.

Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
The process of gathering ,recording,evaluating,verifying and overseeing software requirements is known as requirements engineering. As it creates the groundwork for the successful developments and expectactions of its stakrholders,it is a crucial stage in the software system that satisfies the requirements engineering process:
1.Elicitation: Using methods like workshops,quistionnairies and interviews needs are gathered from a variety of stakeholders including clients end users and other parties.
2.Documentation: Utilising methods like as requirement specifications use cases and user stories to clearly and concisely capture and record the needs.
3.Analysis: Examining and ranking the requirements to make sure they are comprehensive,coherent and doable.
4.Validation: Confirming the specifications.

Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
In order to create and execute software systems software engineering adhere to a set of basic standards and best practices called software design principles. With the help of these guidelines the programme should be more scalable, maintainable and of higher quility:
1.Modularity improves maintanability and scalability by reducing coupling and dependencies between components.
2.Encapsulating complexity within individual modules.
3. Allowing for incremental updates and refactoring.
4.Enabling parallel development and testing.
5.Facilitating the addition of new features and functionalities.
6.Improving overall system flexibility and adaptability.

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Before software is published to users, it must pass several levels of testing to guarantee that is dependable functional and bug free. The various software testing levels are as follows:
1 Unit testing: Unit testing is the initial stage of testing in which separate parts or code units are examined separetly. Test cases are created by developres to assess each unit's functionality and make sureit operates as intended.
2. Integration testing: In order to make sure that various units or modules interact correctly when combined ,integration testing is conducted. This stage of testing aids in locating any potential problems that might occur when parts are integrated.
  3.  System testing: Is conducted on the complete system to validate that the software meets the specified requirements and functions as intended. It focuses on testing the entire system's functionality,perfomance and security.
   4. Acceptance testing: Acceptance testing is the final level of testing where the software is evaluated to dertemine if it meets the user's requirements and is ready for deployment. This testing is typically done by end users or stakeholders to ensure that the software meets their needs.
      
Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
A version control system tracks every alteration to a file or set of files enabling developers to journey back to earlier versions and collaborate seamleassly. Version control is important for keeping track of changes to code,files and other digital assests.(Deep.N.,et al.2020). Here are some of (VCS)examples and their features:
1.Git :
Distributed version control
Branching and merging
Local repositories
Fast perfomance
Open source
Large community and ecosystem
2.Mercurial:
Distributed version control
Fast perfomance
Easy to use
Scalable
Supports large repositories
4. Perforce:
Centralized version control
High perfomance
Large file Support
Built in project management

Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Supervising the planning implementation and completion of software projects inside an organisation is a critical responsibility of the software project manager. An essential duties of a project manager for software are sa follows:
1.Project Planinning: constructing schedules specifying goals establishing benchmarks and effeciently allocating resources are all part of project planning.
2.Team management: Assembling and managing a group of experts comprised of developers,testers,designers and other specialists to guarantee cooperation and efficiency during the projects duration.
3. Stakeholder management: corresponding with clients team members and stakeholders to ascertain needs give updates and resolve issue or modifications to the projects scope.
Challenges faced in managing software projects are :
1.Scope creep: changes in projrct requirements or the addition of the new features during the development process can lead to scope ceaap which can impact timelines and budgets.
2.Resourse managment: effective resource management is essential to the completion of a project.
3.Timeline and budget constraints: mananging projects timelines and budgets while ensuring quility and meeting stakeholder expectations can be a delicate balancing act ,requiring careful planning and monitoring throughout the project lifecycle
Software Maintenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
The practice of altering ,upgrading software programmes in order to fix bugs , boost effeciency,include new features or adjust to environmental changes is known as software maincanance. It ensure that the software contains to meet the evolving needs and requiments of its users.The are several types of maintanance:
1.correctivew maintanance: This involves fixing bugs and defects identified in the software aftere it has been deployed.
2.Adaptive maintanance : This type of maintanance is perfomed to make the software compatible with changes in the external enviroment such as changes in operating sysyems, hardware platforms or regulatory requirements.
3.Perfective maintanance: Perfective maintanance aims to improve the perfomance maintability and usabilityof the software.
4. Preventive maintanance: Its involves making changes to software to prevent future issues or improve its long term maintanability.
Software maintanance is important for :
